# Advent-of-Code-2020
My submission for the adventofcode.com/2020 challenge

## Summary of challenges

These are the summary of the technical requirements. The actual challenge comes with a wonderful Christmas story.

- Day 1 (December 1)
  Given a list of numbers, find the pair of number which gives the sum equal to `2020`. Return the product of the pair.
  Do the same thing, but now find three numbers with the sum `2020` and return its product.

- Day 2 (December 2)

  Given a delimited text file of passwords and password requirements, determine the number of passwords that meet the requirements.
  For example, an entry in the text file `13-16 k: kkkkkgmkbvkkrskhd` means that the password `kkkkkgmkbvkkrskhd` must contain exactly between `13` and `16` instances of the letter `k` for it to meet requirements.
